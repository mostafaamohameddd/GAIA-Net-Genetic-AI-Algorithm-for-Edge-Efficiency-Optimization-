GAIA-Net: Hardware-Aware NAS for Green IoT Edge
(Genetic AI Algorithm for Edge Efficiency Optimization)

A production-grade Neural Architecture Search (NAS) system that utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to discover and optimize Deep Learning model architectures for deployment on resource-constrained IoT Edge devices. The primary focus is achieving Green AI by balancing high accuracy with minimized model size and inference time.

The final optimized architecture is packaged and served through a Flask Web Interface, demonstrating deployment readiness and adherence to strict hardware constraints.
